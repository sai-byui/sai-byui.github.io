## Current Projects

#### Autonomous Remote Control Car
An RC car is made to recognize it's surroundings through a machine learning image regocnition algorithm. A Raspberry Pi 3 is used to control to car. The source code and the wiki can be found in the [repository](https://github.com/sai-byui/arcc).

#### Battleship AI 
A solid state machine built in C++ to play the game battleship. We currently have 2 versions of an AI developed last semester and we are looking to improve them and implement other strategies with the goal of defeting human players. The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/sai-byui/BattleShipAI).

#### NEO the Learning Softbot
Neo is an agent designed to interact and learn from objects in its environment. Its framework is built upon concepts in Agent Oriented Programming which allow its source code to be completely autonomous from the environment (it can be placed into a new environment without breaking). The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/sai-byui/NEO_Learning_Softbot).
