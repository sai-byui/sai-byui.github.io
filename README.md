<h2>About</h2>
All the projects that the society's members work on is public. The repositories are located [here](https://github.com/sai-byui). Currently our meetings are held in the STC 385 Tuesdays and Thursdays @ 6pm

<h4>Current Projects</h4>

<h4>Autonomous Remote Control Car</h4>
An RC car is made to recognize it's surroundings through a machine learning image regocnition algorithm. A Raspberry Pi 3 is used to control to car. The source code and the wiki can be found in the [repository](https://github.com/sai-byui/arcc).

<h4>Battleship AI </h4>
A solid state machine built in C++ to play the game battleship. We currently have 2 versions of an AI developed last semester and we are looking to improve them and implement other strategies with the goal of defeting human players. The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/sai-byui/BattleShipAI).

<h4>NEO the Learning Softbot</h4>
Neo is an agent designed to interact and learn from objects in its environment. Its framework is built upon concepts in Agent Oriented Programming which allow its source code to be completely autonomous from the environment (it can be placed into a new environment without breaking). The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/sai-byui/NEO_Learning_Softbot).
