## 5.1. Writing Markdown

### Writing Code Snippets
Markdown supports not only code snippets, but highlighting just like a text editor. To make a code snipped, write three backticks before and after:
> ```syntax
> function myFunc(p) {
>   console.log("Hello World!");
> }
> ```

Replace 'syntax' with the syntax you are using. For example, for JavaScript, write 'js':

<pre>
```js
function myFunc(p) {
  console.log("Hello World!");
}
```
</pre>

```js
function helloWorld(name) {
  console.log("Hello World!");
  console.log("My name is ", name);
}
```

Or for Python, write:
<pre>
```py
def guess_game(num):
  guess = int(input("Guess: "))
  print("Your guess was ", "correct!" if guess is num else "incorrect :(")
```
</pre>

```py
def guess_game(num):
  guess = int(input("Guess: "))
  print("Your guess was ", "correct!" if guess is num else "incorrect :(")
```
