## 4.1. Writing Markdown

### Writing Code Snippets

### Syntax Highlighting
Markdown supports not only code snippets, but highlighting just like a text editor. To make a code snipped, write three backticks before and after:
> ```syntax
> function myFunc(p) {
>   console.log("Hello World!");
> }
> ```
Replace 'syntax' with the syntax you are using. For example, for JavaScript, write 'js':
> ```js
> function myFunc(p) {
>   console.log("Hello World!");
> }
> ```

```js
function helloWorld(name) {
  console.log("Hello World!");
  console.log("My name is ", name);
}
```

Or for Python, write:
> ```py
> def guess_game(num):
>   guess = int(input("Guess: "))
>   print("Your guess was ", "correct!" if guess is num else "incorrect :(")
> ```

```py
def guess_game(num):
  guess = int(input("Guess: "))
  print("Your guess was ", "correct!" if guess is num else "incorrect :(")
```
