## Learning Python

Rather than teach you everything there is to know about python, we feel it better to redirect you to an established lesson. There are already many high quality tutorials out there.

```py
import random
MAX_NUM = 100

number = random.randint(0,MAX_NUM)
guess = int(input(f"What's the number? Guess a number from 1 to {MAX_NUM}: "))

while guess is not number:
    
    if guess < number:
      print("Too low!")
    
    elif guess > number:
      print("Too high!")
    
    guess = int(input(f"What's the number? Guess a number from 1 to {MAX_NUM}: "))

print("You win!")
