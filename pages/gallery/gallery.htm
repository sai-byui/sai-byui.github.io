                <h4>Modular Voice Assistant</h4>
                <p>
                    Built as a capstone project, this voice assistant features multiple speech to text and text to speech engines, 
                    over 100 different voices, and easy skill-building for implementation in anything from a replica Iron Man helmet
                    to a fully functional smart-house. Did I mention that it has name customizability through 
                    the <a href="https://picovoice.ai/platform/porcupine/" target="_blank">Porcupine Wake Word engine</a>?
                    <br>
                    Check it out at <a href="https://github.com/aamott/Nora-Voice-Assistant">github.com/aamott/alfred-protocol</a>. The author is active on GitHub.

                <h4>Battleship AI </h4>
                <p>
                    A solid state machine built in C++ to play the game battleship.
                    We currently have 2 versions of an AI developed last semester 
                    and we are looking to improve them and implement other strategies 
                    with the goal of defeting human players. 
                    The code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/sai-byui/BattleShipAI">here</a>.

                <p>
                    An RC car is made to recognize it's surroundings through a machine learning image regocnition algorithm.
                    A Raspberry Pi 3 is used to control to car. 
                    The source code and the wiki can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/sai-byui/arcc">repository</a>.

                <h4>NEO the Learning Softbot</h4>
                <p>
                    Neo is an agent designed to interact and learn from objects in its environment. 
                    Its framework is built upon concepts in Agent Oriented Programming which allow 
                    its source code to be completely autonomous from the environment 
                    (it can be placed into a new environment without breaking). 
                    The code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/sai-byui/NEO_Learning_Softbot">here</a>.
