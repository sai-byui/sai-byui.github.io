                <h4>Alfred - The Assistant</h4>
                <p>
                    Alfred is a voice assistant built on the idea of simplicity and reprogrammability while being fully featured. 
                    Its code should be simple and deeply commented enough for most early programmers to understand 
                    and modify.

                <h4>Battleship AI </h4>
                <p>
                    A solid state machine built in C++ to play the game battleship.
                    We currently have 2 versions of an AI developed last semester 
                    and we are looking to improve them and implement other strategies 
                    with the goal of defeting human players. 
                    The code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/sai-byui/BattleShipAI">here</a>.

                <p>
                    An RC car is made to recognize it's surroundings through a machine learning image regocnition algorithm.
                    A Raspberry Pi 3 is used to control to car. 
                    The source code and the wiki can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/sai-byui/arcc">repository</a>.

                <h4>NEO the Learning Softbot</h4>
                <p>
                    Neo is an agent designed to interact and learn from objects in its environment. 
                    Its framework is built upon concepts in Agent Oriented Programming which allow 
                    its source code to be completely autonomous from the environment 
                    (it can be placed into a new environment without breaking). 
                    The code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/sai-byui/NEO_Learning_Softbot">here</a>.
